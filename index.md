  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I have 4 years of expertise in leveraging Python, SQL, and Fortran for the analysis of extensive simulation data, which involves terabytes of atomic coordinates, to derive insights for complex technical challenges. My proficiency in visualization and effective communication has also been honed and demonstrated through presentations at several conferences.
